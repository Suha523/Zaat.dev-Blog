Zaat.dev is a web development company founded earlier this year, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no office! Zaat’s team, projects’, and everything in between is managed remotely. So basically, the remote culture is one of Zaat’s core values. Now, proudly we can announce that Zaat.dev became a trusted EU company. Through applying to the Estonian e-Residency program, which gave Zaat.dev a presence in the EU and enabled it to become a location-independent company. The motivation behind taking the step forward and applying to the e-Residency program is to be a part of the worldwide virtual business environment that Estonia created.

One can simply lookup for any Estonian company through Estonia's e-Business Register by entering the company name, e.g. “Zaatdev” or its registry code “16084536”. What does e-Residency mean? e-Residency gives entrepreneurs the ability to apply for a digital residency in Estonia, even though they don’t actually live there. Simply, e-Residency allowed us to establish a trusted Estonian limited company “Zaadev OÜ”, -“OÜ” stands for “osaühing” in Estonian which means limited in English-, that can be run from anywhere in the world, to serve clients worldwide. How does it work? To become an e-Resident Estonian, you have to apply online, pay a state fee, and choose a pickup location for your digital ID. This digital ID card enables you to use Estonian public and private sector services and resources, sign documents remotely, and encrypt files. Then, you should obtain an Estonian legal address, register your company online in Estonia, and find a fintech partner to cover your banking needs.
