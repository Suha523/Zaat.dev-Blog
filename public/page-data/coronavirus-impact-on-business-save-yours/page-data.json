Coronavirus has brought the global economy to a sudden shock, and its consequences have  reached the businesses in the service sector. Until this moment, many business owners are wondering what recovery could look like! In response, many companies and business owners decided to cut down wages, lay off their employees, and/or to shift their operations online. Fortunately, some coronavirus consequences for business can be prevented by the use of technologies. Technology Against Coronavirus Technology can’t stop the pandmeic, however it can help prevent the spread, warn, and educate people to be aware of the situation, noticeably lessening the impact and force them to follow the social-distancing rules.
